## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Clone the forked repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DataScience-with-Python.git
   ```

3. Create a new branch for your contribution:

   ```
   git checkout -b your-branch-name
   ```

4. Make the necessary changes or additions to the codebase.
5. Test your changes thoroughly, especially if you're implementing new algorithms or modifying existing ones.
6. Document your code, ensuring clarity and providing examples where necessary.
7. Commit your changes using descriptive commit messages:

   ```
   git commit -m "Implement PCA algorithm"
   ```

8. Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```
   git push origin your-branch-name
   ```

9. Open a pull request from your branch to the main repository.

Once your pull request is submitted, it will be reviewed by the project maintainers. Feedback or additional changes may be requested, so please be responsive to comments during the review process.

## Commit Guidelines

When making commits, please follow these guidelines:

- Use present tense in your commit messages ("Implement PCA algorithm" instead of "Implemented PCA algorithm").
