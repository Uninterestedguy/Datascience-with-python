# Lambda Functions

Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small and inline functions in Python that can be defined without a name. These functions are typically used when we need a simple, one-line function for a specific task. Lambda functions are called using the keyword `lambda` followed by the parameters and a colon, and then the expression or operation to be performed.

Here's an example of a lambda function that takes two parameters and returns their sum:

```python
fun = lambda param1, param2: param1 + param2
```

# Anonymous Functions

Anonymous functions allow us to apply a function to each item in a sequence. The `map()` function in Python can be used to apply a given function to each item of a sequence and return the results as a new list. Similarly, the `filter()` function can be used to filter out items from a sequence based on a given function.

Here's an example of using `map()` and `filter()` functions:

```python
# Applying a function to each item in a sequence
result = map(func, seq)

# Filtering items from a sequence
result = filter(func, seq)
```

# Error Handling

Error handling, also known as exception handling, is the process of dealing with errors or exceptions that occur during the runtime of a program. Python provides mechanisms to catch and handle exceptions to prevent the program from crashing when an error occurs.

# Handling Exceptions

In Python, we can handle exceptions using the `try-except` statement. The code that might raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and if an exception occurs, it is caught by the corresponding `except` block. The `except` block specifies the type of exception to catch and the code to execute when that exception occurs.

Here's an example of a `sqrt()` function that calculates the square root of a number, and handles the exception if the input is not a valid number:

```python
def sqrt(x):
    try:
        return x ** 0.5
    except:
        print("x must be an int or float")
```

# Raising an Error

In Python, we can raise our own exceptions using the `raise` keyword. This allows us to explicitly raise an exception when a certain condition is met or an error occurs. By raising an exception, we can communicate and handle errors in a more controlled manner.
